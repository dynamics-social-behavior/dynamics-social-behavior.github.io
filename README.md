# Personal Website for the Group Dynamics of Social Behavior

Welcome to the source code for our website.

## A new member joined the group?

In our group, every member becomes a collaborator in this repository. This allows
everyone to push code and contribute easily. There are other ways to handle
this, but we prefer to keep things simple.

To add a new member as a collaborator, see: [Invite new members to our website](HowTos/InviteCollaborators.md)

## Updating the website

The website is hosted on GitHub. To make changes, all you need to do is update
the main branch of this repository. See the How To(s)" section to learn how to do that.


## First time contributing to the website?
