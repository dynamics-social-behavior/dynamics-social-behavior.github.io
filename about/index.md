  <h5 class="section-title">Research Statement</h5>
  <p class="intro-text">
    Based on the <a href="https://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017.pdf" class="highlight-link">European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="research-text">
    Good research practices are based on fundamental principles of research integrity. These principles guide researchers in their work as well as in their engagement with the practical, ethical, and intellectual challenges inherent in research. They are:
  </p>
  
  <ul class="research-list">
    <li>Reliability in ensuring the quality of research, reflected in the design, methodology, analysis, and use of resources.</li>
    <li>Honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting, and communicating research in a transparent, fair, full, and unbiased way.</li>
    <li>Respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage, and the environment.</li>
    <li>Accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="research-text">
    As a research group, we strive to follow these principles.
  </p>

  <h5 class="section-title">Diversity Statement</h5>
  <p class="diversity-text">
    We encourage everyone to apply to be a member of our group and are committed to building a research group for all.
  </p>

  <p class="diversity-text">
    Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, national origin, political beliefs, race, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.
